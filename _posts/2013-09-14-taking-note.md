This semester I've started taking notes using markdown. It is quick and easy to outline, write code snippets, and format the text. But I was struggling to find a descent enough 'compiler' to convert the markdown plain text into html... so I created one this weekend.

Thus, <del>DropNoteIt</del> <del>MarkNote</del> <del>NoteIt</del> **TakingNote** was born!

<a href="https://takingnote.herokuapp.com/landing.html"><img src="http://theisensanders.com/assets/img/projects/note_app.png" alt="TakeNote"></img></a>

**Current Features:**

- Powered by [Dropbox Datastore API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore) (*If you've never used this awesome service by Dropbox, give it a try!*)
- Built on AngularJS framework
- Create/Delete/Edit notes in plaintext, automatically compiled to markdown
- Much improved UI from original prototypes
- Collapsible sidebar for easy access to notes
- Quickly and easily upload a file to your Dropbox and the link will automatically be inserted into to your document.

The open-source project is available here:

Tha app itself is avaliable here:
