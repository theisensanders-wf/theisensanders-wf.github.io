This is more of a milestone than a blog post. My first take at a portfolio/blogging website was nothing but a [wrapbootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/) template with some custom-rolled elements. That site was written while I was in school, but now that I'm done and have free time I decided to build a site from (almost) scratch.

And now, you are reading this blog post on the new site!

I've never been a great designer but something I've started doing over the past few months is bookmarking sites I stumble upon that have a nice UI. To make this site, I borrowed bits and pieces from those sites that I liked and put them together into this one.

I've got some new cool projects coming down the line so stay tuned.
