*Edit:* This post references the first version of my website. Read about the latest version in a blog post coming soon!

A partially implemented version of my personal website has been sitting in a github repo untouched for over a year.
Now that it is time to graduate and figure out what comes next, I decided it was finally time to scrap all
the work I've done on it and start over.

Between work and school, my free time for working on projects such as this has been limited. The unfortunate
part is that my self-motivated projects are what help me learn the most. However, this semester I'm particularly
interested in a couple of my classes because I really have no idea where they are going to take me. Specifically, my
Artificial Intelligence class will be incredibly interesting. We will touch on data mining, a concept I've become
familiar with at WebFilings. I've realized just how much data there is out there for the taking, and how useful
that data can be.

Anyways, back to the website. I wanted something just as functional as it is pleasing to the eye. And I found
that it was more of a "pick one" scenario. Here is how my build process evolved during this project:

1. Started by writing a built-from-scratch site, no frameworks
2. *Realized how impractical that was*
3. Began writing a basic site using Bootstrap 3
4. *Realized that I'm tired of the same old Bootstrap look*
5. Found a theme I really liked and tailored it to fit what I needed.

As much as I would've loved to create my own theme, the time was just not there. So as I mentioned in the footer, v2.0
is a work in progress that likely will not get enough love until after I graduate.

Please leave me some comments or suggestions on the new site [here](http://theisensanders.com/#section5).
